## Facial-Expression-dectector using deep learning

## Introduction

This project aims to classify the emotion on a person's face into one of **seven categories**.
- **angry**
- **disgusted**
- **fearful**
- **happy**
- **neutral**
- **sad**
- **surprised**
using deep convolutional neural networks. The model is trained on the [**FER-2013**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data)
dataset which was published on International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).
This dataset consists of 35887 grayscale, 48x48 sized face images with **seven emotions** - angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad and surprised.
